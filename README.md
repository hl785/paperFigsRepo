# paperFigsRepo
Okay I am going crazy with all these subfolders with different figures and versions in them.
Whats more I know we are going to have to make these over and over again for sizing.
So I will make one big script that tracks all the figures and generates all of them.
This will have variables for the figure width and aspect ratio for all figures.
